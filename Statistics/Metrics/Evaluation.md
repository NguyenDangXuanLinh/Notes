# Use _after_ training model
it helps with: 
1. select hyperparameter settings
2. choose the best performed model (among competing ones)

## Evaluation Metrics
scoring function: higher function's scores -> better prediction results -> choose that model
error function: smaller error quantities -> better predictions

## Regression problems - use error measures
 Mean squared error (MSE)
 MSE = sum((predict - actual values)^2) -> sum()/number of predict
